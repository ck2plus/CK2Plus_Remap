# CK2Plus_Remap
We gonna do it! No more crapnilla vanilla crap map.

TODO list, with dependencies:


BLOCKED: 	Provinces	- currently blocked until 2.8 CK2 release, except for Zeress and vukica
						- work should be split per regions.
          
BLOCKED:	Positions 	- Once a region is complete positions should be done immediately.

			Minimap   	- vukica will do it ASAP. - on hold.

			rivers		- Colormap has minor rivers, so those should be painted on the rivers.bmp in correct palette.
						- Once they're painted, they need to be removed from colourmap
		
			trees		- This can probably be done before JD.

			eu4c		- once done, province mapping may have to be rearranged
			
			one pixel	- remove one/two pixel islands and lakes. they don't look very good. this needs to be updated in every file!
						- easiest way to do it is to first match the province map to topology, then smoooth out the topology, and finally,
						match terrain and rivers to province map.
			

NOTE: palettes are available in main repo in CK2Plus_misc.
