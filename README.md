# CK2Plus_Remap
We gonna do it! No more crapnilla vanilla crap map.

TODO list, with dependencies:


BLOCKED: 	Provinces	- currently blocked until 2.8 CK2 release.
						- work should be split per regions.
          
BLOCKED:	Positions 	- currently blocked by provinces task. Once a region is complete positions should be done immediately.

			Minimap   	- vukica will do it ASAP.

			rivers		- Colormap has minor rivers, so those should be painted on the rivers.bmp in correct palette.
						There's a chance they may have to be removed from colormap, but probably not.
			trees		- This can probably be done before JD.

			eu4c		- once done, province mapping may have to be rearranged
			
			one pixel	- remove one/two pixel islands and lakes. they don't look very good. this needs to be updated in every file!
			

NOTE: palettes are available in main repo in CK2Plus_misc.
