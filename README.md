# CK2Plus_Remap
We gonna do it! No more crapnilla vanilla crap map.

TODO list, with priorities and dependencies:


BLOCKED: Provinces - currently blocked until 2.8 CK2 release.
          - work should be split per regions.
          
BLOCKED: Positions - currently blocked by provinces task. Once a region is complete positions should be done immediately.

Minimap   - vukica will do it ASAP.

rivers    - Colormap has minor rivers, so those should be painted on the rivers.bmp in correct palette.
          There's a chance they may have to be removed from colormap, but probably not.
trees     - This can probably be done before JD.

NOTE: palettes are available in main repo in CK2Plus_misc.
